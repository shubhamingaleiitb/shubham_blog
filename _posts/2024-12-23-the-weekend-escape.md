# **Book Review: "The Weekend Escape" by Rakie Bennett**

**Rating**: 4 out of 5 stars

If you’re craving a fast-paced, atmospheric read that will keep you up way past bedtime, _The Weekend Escape_ by Rakie Bennett might just be your perfect pick. Equal parts chilling thriller and tense psychological drama, this novel plunges six old friends into a nightmare they never saw coming—all on a seemingly idyllic island retreat.

## **Plot Overview**

Six friends—Lyndsey, Sonia, Bobbie, Amanda, Juliet, and Val—decide to reunite for a weekend of fun and adventure. From the moment they arrive, however, the atmosphere cracks with tension: Amanda gets hurt, a vicious storm rolls in, the island feels strangely hostile, and old, unresolved secrets begin to surface. Their plan to reconnect quickly devolves into a desperate struggle for survival when it becomes clear that someone in their group may be hiding more than just a checkered past.

## **Character Dynamics**

One of the novel’s strengths lies in its authentic portrayal of the group’s personalities and internal conflicts. Each character comes to life with distinct fears, desires, and secrets:

- **Lyndsey** grapples with serious financial issues and a drinking problem.
- **Val** is obsessed with hoarding research, be it about poisons or past—a trait that gets everyone in trouble.
- **Sonia** emerges as the “mean girl” archetype, suspicious and distrustful, further fueling the group’s paranoia.

Bennett skillfully uses these personal tensions to heighten the novel’s psychological stakes. As their camaraderie crumbles and trust becomes a scarce commodity, the reader is left guessing who to believe—and who to fear.

## **Atmospheric Island Setting**

The remote island setting is vividly depicted, from the pounding waves and treacherous cliffs to the howling winds that close in on the group. You can almost feel the salt spray in the air and sense the claustrophobic isolation that eats away at each friend’s nerves. The author does a superb job conveying how both nature and their own paranoia conspire against them.

## **Twists, Turns, and Tension**

_The Weekend Escape_ delivers plenty of twists and turns, checking all the boxes for a classic psychological thriller. While some readers might find the ending somewhat predictable, the real thrill lies in the journey—uncovering each character’s hidden truths, navigating the thickening suspense, and witnessing the unraveling of a once-tight-knit circle of friends.

The “whodunnit” element remains compelling throughout, with every chapter leaving you more uncertain about who might be responsible for the escalating sense of doom. Even though the ultimate reveal might not be entirely shocking, the emotional roller coaster and gritty survival scenes make for an engrossing ride.

## **Final Thoughts**

Overall, _The Weekend Escape_ is an immersive thriller that expertly balances character-driven drama with edge-of-your-seat suspense. With its carefully crafted setting, layered characters, and a steadily rising tide of tension, Rakie Bennett offers a riveting reading experience. If you love psychological thrillers set in isolated locales—and enjoy watching old friendships put to the ultimate test—this book should be on your reading list.
