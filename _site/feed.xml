<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4 out of 5 stars</p>

<p>If you’re craving a fast-paced, atmospheric read that will keep you up way past bedtime, <em>The Weekend Escape</em> by Rakie Bennett might just be your perfect pick. Equal parts chilling thriller and tense psychological drama, this novel plunges six old friends into a nightmare they never saw coming—all on a seemingly idyllic island retreat.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="plot-overview"><strong>Plot Overview</strong></h2>

<p>Six friends—Lyndsey, Sonia, Bobbie, Amanda, Juliet, and Val—decide to reunite for a weekend of fun and adventure. From the moment they arrive, however, the atmosphere cracks with tension: Amanda gets hurt, a vicious storm rolls in, the island feels strangely hostile, and old, unresolved secrets begin to surface. Their plan to reconnect quickly devolves into a desperate struggle for survival when it becomes clear that someone in their group may be hiding more than just a checkered past.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="character-dynamics"><strong>Character Dynamics</strong></h2>

<p>One of the novel’s strengths lies in its authentic portrayal of the group’s personalities and internal conflicts. Each character comes to life with distinct fears, desires, and secrets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lyndsey</strong> grapples with serious financial issues and a drinking problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Val</strong> is obsessed with hoarding research, be it about poisons or past—a trait that gets everyone in trouble.</li>
  <li><strong>Sonia</strong> emerges as the “mean girl” archetype, suspicious and distrustful, further fueling the group’s paranoia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bennett skillfully uses these personal tensions to heighten the novel’s psychological stakes. As their camaraderie crumbles and trust becomes a scarce commodity, the reader is left guessing who to believe—and who to fear.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="atmospheric-island-setting"><strong>Atmospheric Island Setting</strong></h2>

<p>The remote island setting is vividly depicted, from the pounding waves and treacherous cliffs to the howling winds that close in on the group. You can almost feel the salt spray in the air and sense the claustrophobic isolation that eats away at each friend’s nerves. The author does a superb job conveying how both nature and their own paranoia conspire against them.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="twists-turns-and-tension"><strong>Twists, Turns, and Tension</strong></h2>

<p><em>The Weekend Escape</em> delivers plenty of twists and turns, checking all the boxes for a classic psychological thriller. While some readers might find the ending somewhat predictable, the real thrill lies in the journey—uncovering each character’s hidden truths, navigating the thickening suspense, and witnessing the unraveling of a once-tight-knit circle of friends.</p>

<p>The “whodunnit” element remains compelling throughout, with every chapter leaving you more uncertain about who might be responsible for the escalating sense of doom. Even though the ultimate reveal might not be entirely shocking, the emotional roller coaster and gritty survival scenes make for an engrossing ride.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, <em>The Weekend Escape</em> is an immersive thriller that expertly balances character-driven drama with edge-of-your-seat suspense. With its carefully crafted setting, layered characters, and a steadily rising tide of tension, Rakie Bennett offers a riveting reading experience. If you love psychological thrillers set in isolated locales—and enjoy watching old friendships put to the ultimate test—this book should be on your reading list.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A gripping psychological thriller by Rakie Bennett, where six old friends find that their island getaway quickly becomes a deadly game of secrets and survival.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Survival Guide to Placement Season, IIT Bombay</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2024/12/18/placement-season.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Survival Guide to Placement Season, IIT Bombay" /><published>2024-12-18T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2024-12-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2024/12/18/placement-season</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2024/12/18/placement-season.html"><![CDATA[<p><em>P.S. This blog post is specifically catered towards students aiming for placements in the tech domain.</em></p>

<p>I got placed on Day 10 of the placement season, which felt late compared to my peers, but I learned that aiming for a profile you truly love matters more than getting placed early. I didn’t receive any shortlists till Day 7, despite feeling that my test performances went well. Once I got an interview call for a company which required basic data science—but I had worked so hard to understand advanced ML—I chose not to go for that interview. Eventually, on my third interview, I landed a job I was excited about. I’ve seen friends who spent years on advanced ML and AI projects but settled for roles unrelated to their expertise just for an earlier placement. If you’ve worked hard in a certain domain, don’t abandon it under pressure. Yes, a higher CPI can attract more shortlists, but if you remain patient and stay true to your interests, the right opportunity will come your way.</p>

<p>Placement season is a major event for most final-year students, and it’s natural to feel overwhelmed with questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I didn’t do an internship—what now?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>I don’t have strong projects—how can I prepare?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>I didn’t focus on DSA—am I doomed?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>I don’t have any PoRs (Positions of Responsibility)—will it hurt my chances?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>These concerns are valid, but they don’t define your success. With focus and strategy, you can tackle these challenges and secure great opportunities. Let’s address them one by one.</p>

<h2 id="i-didnt-do-an-internshipwhat-now">I Didn’t Do an Internship—What Now?</h2>

<p>Internships provide valuable experience and boost your resume, but not having one isn’t the end of the road. While you can’t fully make up for an internship, you can minimize its impact by:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Building Relevant Projects:</strong> Create or improve projects that showcase your technical skills and problem-solving abilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Contributing to Open Source:</strong> It’s challenging but a great way to demonstrate coding skills and collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, internships are important but not the only factor that matters. Highlighting your skills and showing initiative can make a strong impression.</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-have-strong-projectswhat-should-i-do">I Don’t Have Strong Projects—What Should I Do?</h2>

<p>Projects are key to showcasing your technical abilities. If you think your projects aren’t good enough:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>List All Your Work:</strong> Include course assignments, self-initiated projects, and group collaborations.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on Relevance:</strong> Highlight projects that solve real-world problems or involve tools mentioned in common job descriptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Borrow Ideas, Learn Later:</strong> Add projects from seniors’ resumes if needed. Use the 2–3 months between resume submission and interviews to thoroughly understand and refine them. Be honest during interviews about your contributions and learning process.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even borrowed projects can impress if you demonstrate genuine understanding and growth.</p>
<h2 id="i-didnt-focus-on-dsawhat-should-i-do">I Didn’t Focus on DSA—What Should I Do?</h2>

<p>It’s never too late to start learning Data Structures and Algorithms. There’s always a chance you’ll be asked questions from topics you’re familiar with. For example, during my placements, I only knew till <strong>linked lists</strong>, but I got lucky and was asked an <strong>arrays</strong> question in my interview—and I managed to answer it and got selected. That said, luck isn’t always on your side, so it’s important to start preparing now. Focus on the basics and build from there.</p>

<h3 id="does-the-language-matter">Does the Language Matter?</h3>
<p>The programming language you use doesn’t matter much in interviews and online assessments. What matters is how you solve the problem. If you’re not too familiar with any specific language, I’d recommend starting with <strong>Python</strong>. It’s easier to learn, has a simple syntax, and allows you to focus more on problem-solving than coding nuances.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Start with Basics:</strong> Focus on Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Sorting, Hashmaps, and Sets—these are the most common topics.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice Smartly:</strong> Solve <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>medium</strong> questions on <strong>LeetCode</strong>. Hard problems are rarely asked.</li>
  <li><strong>Stay Consistent:</strong> Dedicate time daily. Small efforts add up quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Stay Positive:</strong> You don’t need to master everything. Even solving basic questions can prepare you well.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="i-dont-have-any-porswhat-should-i-do">I Don’t Have Any PoRs—What Should I Do?</h2>

<p>Positions of Responsibility (PoRs) are helpful but not mandatory in tech placements. If you don’t have any, focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Other Achievements:</strong> Highlight technical skills and projects in your resume.</li>
  <li><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Show teamwork and communication skills through examples in interviews.</li>
  <li><strong>Core Strengths:</strong> Strong technical knowledge and problem-solving ability matter more than PoRs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many successful candidates get placed without PoRs. Your skills and preparation are what count most.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Placement season is tough, and it’s easy to feel discouraged—especially when you see some friends getting placed early or seemingly getting lucky. <strong>Luck is a part of the process, and you can’t change that.</strong> Some students do get unbelievably lucky, but instead of letting it affect your mental health, embrace it and focus on your own journey.</p>

<p>What you <em>can</em> control is your hard work and preparation. Stay consistent, trust yourself, and believe that your efforts will pay off. Remember: <strong>everyone gets placed eventually—it’s only a matter of when.</strong> Keep pushing forward, and your time will come.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A no-nonsense guide.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Survival Guide to Internship Season, IIT Bombay</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2024/06/13/internship-season.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Survival Guide to Internship Season, IIT Bombay" /><published>2024-06-13T20:11:48+05:30</published><updated>2024-06-13T20:11:48+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2024/06/13/internship-season</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2024/06/13/internship-season.html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a no bullshit guide to navigate through the challenges you would face during your Internship Season at IIT Bombay. It is one of the most important experiences of our college life. It is filled with stress, anxiety and excitement. Internship season forces you to question your career and which path you want to follow in life. In this guide, I’ll try my best to provide you with ideas which will help you enjoy this phase.</p>

<p>There are various preparation sessions conducted by UGAC and Placement Cell before internship season starts. All the sessions are given by “machau” seniors, and I feel a normal student fails to connect with them. Atleast I failed to connect with them. I know there are plenty students who feel the same. I am not a “9 pointer” nor I have any minors. When I look at those seniors who are giving advice in these session, have “9 pointer” and dual minor, it discouraged me. It made me question, do I have a chance? Firstly, let me assure you, you have a chance. I secured an internship in the field of Data Science much later (around March 2024) in the internship season. I’m not an “ideal” student, but that is the whole point of this blog, advice from “not so ideal” student.</p>

<h1 id="beginning-is-rough">Beginning is rough</h1>

<p>I wasted my summers after my second year ended, which is a huge mistake. I often tell juniors not to repeat this. You don’t have to “build a rocket” in summers, but exploring different fields and doing a few project will help you a lot. Don’t be clueless about internship season. When the season starts, you’ll have to sign IAFs (here CPI thing will bug you sometimes). Tests begin shortly after, in Tech profiles, it’s mostly DSA questions. <strong>Practice DSA</strong>, don’t miss out on this. I had a hard time during these tests as I was not well prepared. No matter how good your projects or communication skills are, if you are not able to clear the coding round, you don’t get an interview.</p>

<h1 id="disease-of-comparison">Disease of comparison</h1>

<p>Plague of comparison spreads through the institute once selections announcements begin. You would see someone who worked hard getting an internship and someone who got lucky. Yes, luck is a significant part of the process. This will ignite rage, jealousy and self doubt. If you wasted your summers or don’t have a good CPI, regret will start setting in. This is a tough time. Me and my friends had ranting session a few nights which lasted for hours, about regrets or about how someone got lucky or praising someone who worked hard.</p>

<p><img src="/shubham_blog/img/graden-blog2.jpg" alt="quote" /></p>

<p>Instead of focusing on others, channelize all your focus and energy on yourself (I know this is hard to follow, but this will help you a lot.)</p>

<p>I didn’t get a single interview in my 5<sup>th</sup> semester. This was a difficult time for me. In my 5<sup>th</sup> semester, I applied to all the internships I was eligible for, tech and non-tech. This is not a good strategy. I advice you to think about what you want to follow, tech or non-tech and start preparing for that.</p>

<h1 id="ray-of-hope">Ray of hope</h1>

<p>Winter vacation started, I knew I had to pivot. I chose Data Science. Why? I liked it and a lot of internship profiles were in the domain of Data Science. I spent my winters learning Python and developing various projects. I got my first interview in mid-December. I wasn’t prepared. I got rejected. But I had learnt my lesson, I focused all my energy in developing my skills.</p>

<p><img src="/shubham_blog/img/focus-on-self.jpg" alt="quote" /></p>

<p>Internship season really challenges your self confidence. But remember to hold your ground in these difficult times. As George Bernard Shaw said, “Life is about creating yourself.” Build resilience. View challenging times as an opportunity to level up. Many students feel that, I have already wasted a lot of time and everyone is ahead of me. But remember,</p>

<p><strong>Thinking about wasted time is wasting more time. Start taking action now.</strong></p>

<h1 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h1>

<p>After failing many interviews and tests in my 6<sup>th</sup> semester, I was finally able to secure an internship through Placement cell. Also remember, you don’t have to sit in the hope of Placement Cell bringing the opportunity to you. You should start “apping” as well. But the most important lesson here is that, believe in yourself and your abilities. I heard this amazing thing which inspires me a lot,</p>

<p><strong>A bird sits on a very weak branch of tree which could fall at any time, but the bird isn’t scared. Source of bird’s confidence in not the branch but his wings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Trust yourself and keep working hard.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A no bullshit guide.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fear</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2022/06/10/fear.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fear" /><published>2022-06-10T20:11:48+05:30</published><updated>2022-06-10T20:11:48+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2022/06/10/fear</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/shubham_blog/jekyll/update/2022/06/10/fear.html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to talk about something: Fear. We all have fears. Fear of failing. Fear of falling behind. Fear of incompetence. You and me, all alike have different different fears. And when fear strikes you, you get paralyzed, believe me I have felt it and I feel it sometimes now too. Your eyes get wet. There is nothing wrong in crying. I cried.</p>

<p>But we often misunderstand something that fighting fear is not a one day thing. You have to fight it every single day. From the moment the alaram clocks rings to the lonely time before we go to sleep.</p>

<p>It will haunt you many times in a day. But remember and never forget this, <strong>YOU ARE NOT PERFECT, NOR ANYONE ELSE IS</strong>. You don’t have to look perfect on paper. It’s ok to fail. It’s ok to cry. But the real sign of a fighter is to fight, not to win. Yes we all do mistakes, I do, you do, your parents do, yoursteachers do, your friends do, everybody does. Fight your fears and never give into your fear, what choice do we have other than that. We are fighters and not winners.</p>

<p>There is a sublte difference in fighters and winners. Fighters celebrate the spirit of fighting and strength of character. And winners celebrate the victory.</p>

<p>Fight. Fight. Fight. Be honest, be humble. Because you never know what someone else is going through. Your words might have a great deal of effect on someone who is going through a hard time, never discourage them. Keep learning, keep growing. No one will ignite the fire inside you. Its only you who can do it. Radiate hope into the world.</p>

<p>Let’s make a commitment here. I am making it with you now. 
I will fight and never give up. No matter what the situation. No matter the place or time. I am a fighter. I never give up. I am not perfect, I am not the best, but I will fight like no one else does.</p>

<p><strong>Winners don’t radiate hope. But fighters do.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, I talk about fear.]]></summary></entry></feed>
