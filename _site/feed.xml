We all have fears. Fear of failing. Fear of falling behind. Fear of incompetence. You and me, all alike have different different fears. And when fear strikes you, you get paralyzed, believe me I have felt it and I feel it sometimes now too. Your eyes get wet. There is nothing wrong in crying. I cried.</p>

<p>But we often misunderstand something that fighting fear is not a one day thing. You have to fight it every single day. From the moment the alaram clocks rings to the lonely time before we go to sleep.</p>

<p>It will haunt you many times in a day. But remember and never forget this, <strong>YOU ARE NOT PERFECT, NOR ANYONE ELSE IS</strong>. You don’t have to look perfect on paper. It’s ok to fail. It’s ok to cry. But the real sign of a fighter is to fight, not to win. Yes we all do mistakes, I do, you do, your parents do, yoursteachers do, your friends do, everybody does. Fight your fears and never give into your fear, what choice do we have other than that. We are fighters and not winners.</p>

<p>There is a sublte difference in fighters and winners. Fighters celebrate the spirit of fighting and strength of character. And winners celebrate the victory.</p>

<p>Fight. Fight. Fight. Be honest, be humble. Because you never know what someone else is going through. Your words might have a great deal of effect on someone who is going through a hard time, never discourage them. Keep learning, keep growing. No one will ignite the fire inside you. Its only you who can do it. Radiate hope into the world.</p>

<p>Let’s make a commitment here. I am making it with you now. 
I will fight and never give up. No matter what the situation. No matter the place or time. I am a fighter. I never give up. I am not perfect, I am not the best, but I will fight like no one else does.</p>

<p><strong>Winners don’t radiate hope. But fighters do.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, I talk about fear.]]></summary></entry></feed>
